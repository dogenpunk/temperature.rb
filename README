= Overview 

Temperature makes it easy to deal with temperatures in Ruby, but
adding mixin methods to numbers and strings.  

This was inspired by using Ruby to manipulate data from my home
weather station, and wanting it to keep track of the units for me so
that I didn't have to think about that in code.

== Example

  freezing_in_F = 32
  freezing_in_C = freezing_in_F.to_C

  boiling_in_C = 100
  boiling_in_C.units = "C"
  boiling_in_F = boiling_in_C.to_F

  absolute_zero = "0K".to_degrees
  absolute_zero_in_C = absolute_zero.to_C
  absolute_zero_in_F = absolute_zero.to_F

There is also support to calculate dewpoint from relative humidity
based on the NOAA approximation documented here -
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point#Closer_approximation

  dewpoint = 32.dewpoint(45)

== Installation

First install the gem

  gem install temperature

Then include it in your environment

  require "temperature"
